# PYPTOPAD (PYthon cryPTO PAD)
## Project description
Make your notes secure again!
Pyptopad is (going to be) a simple tool for storing you text notes safe.

## Disclaimer
No warranty, as is and all this crap. Hey, we are not cryptographers, we are just a couple of students who've got to make something for their course.
Bro, if you are looking for an app for organizing of transatlantic cocaine trafficking, pyptopad is probably not your best choice.

## FAQ
### Is pyptopad secure?
See the disclaimer.
### How exactly are my notes encrypted?
work in progress
### Wow, so much crypto... But what if bad guys just guess my password?
We are trying to make bruteforce attacks harder, but if you chose your name and date of birth as your pass, only euthanasia can help you. See [here](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Passwords) for a guide on choosing a good password. 
### How can I trust you?
You can't.
But pyptopad is Free (as in freedom) and Open-Source Software, so nothing stops you from looking through it's source code, luckily it's not gonna be huge.
### Wait, you are from russkies, right? There MUST be FSB backdoors!
Maybe, who knows.
